## 🚴‍♂️ Pedaling Toward Insights: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis 
*Google Data Analytics Capstone Project*

## 📋 Project Summary  
As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I analyzed Cyclistic’s Q1 2020 bike-share data to uncover differences between casual riders and members. Using SQL Server for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for visualization, I identified key trends in trip volume, ride duration, and time-of-day patterns. The findings support targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into loyal members.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
🧹 **Data Cleaning & Analysis:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
📊 **Visualization:** Power BI  
💡 **Skills Applied:** Data wrangling, aggregation, time-based analysis, DAX, data storytelling

## 🔑 Key Tasks  
🗂️ Imported and cleaned raw CSV datasets in SQL Server.  
💻 Developed SQL queries for summary statistics, time trends, and station analysis.  
📈 Designed interactive Power BI dashboard with DAX measures and custom visuals.  
📊 Generated insights and actionable recommendations to support business decisions.

## 💾 SQL Queries  
All SQL queries used for analysis are in the file ['Queries.sql'](./Queries.sql).

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

## 📈 Key Insights  
🚲 Members account for 88.64% of rides (378K trips), casual riders 11.36% (48K trips).  
📅 Member usage dominates each month; January had 136K rides.  
🌱 Casual ridership grows from January (8K) to March (28K), indicating seasonal trends.  
⏱️ Casual riders take longer trips (20.3 min avg) vs. members (10.5 min), suggesting leisure use.  
🏢 Members peak midweek (commute patterns), casual riders peak on weekends (recreational).  
⏰ Start times for members show peaks at 8 AM & 5 PM; casuals show flat usage with slight afternoon activity.

## 🎯 Recommendations  
🎟️ Target casual riders with weekend leisure promotions to convert them into members.  
🚴 Increase bike availability at key stations during weekday peaks and weekend leisure times.  
📍 Focus marketing on stations with high casual rider activity.
